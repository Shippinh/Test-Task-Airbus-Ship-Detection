Current task requires solving one of the problems from the Kaggle platform: Airbus Ship Detection Challenge.
You can find the dataset here: [dataset for test task](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbus-ship-detection/data).
The goal of the test project is to build a semantic segmentation model. Prefered tools and notes: tf.keras, Unet architecture for neural network, dice score, python.

Results of your work should contain next:
● link to GitHub repository with all source codes;
● code for model training and model inference should be separated into different .py files;
● readme.md file with complete description of solution;
● requirements.txt with required python modules;
● jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis of the dataset;
● any other things used during the working with task;

Source code should be well readable and commented;
Project has to be easy to deploy for testing.
